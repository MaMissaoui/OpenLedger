# OpenLedger — Gap Analysis

_Generated 2026-06-20. Audit of the documented roadmap + ARCHITECTURE "Open
considerations" against the code. Snapshot — re-audit before relying on it._

## Roadmap status

Phases 0–3 are **essentially complete**, and phase 4 is **mostly built**.
Confirmed present and tested (so **not** gaps):

- GnuCash import/export in **both SQLite and XML** (gzip + roundtrip tests).
- Reconciliation, trading accounts, lots/capital-gains.
- Scheduled transactions, budgets.
- Securities/portfolio, capital-gains report.
- Full A/R **and** A/P: customer invoices + vendor bills, payments, aging reports.
- Web views for nearly every area.

The real gaps are narrow and specific.

## A. Phase-4 business objects — schema columns exist, backing tables don't

The `customers`/`vendors`/`invoices` tables already carry `terms_guid` and
`taxable`/tax columns, but the objects they point at were never built.

| Gap | Evidence | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**Bill/payment terms** (`billterms`)~~ — **Done.** `billterms` table, domain, CRUD endpoints + web UI; invoice due dates derive from terms | **M** |
| ~~**Tax tables** (`taxtables` + `taxtable_entries`)~~ — **Done.** Tax-rate table + entries, tax applied when posting invoices, web UI | **M–L** |
| ~~**Employees**~~ — **Done.** `employees` table, domain, CRUD endpoints + web UI (entity only; expense vouchers still deferred) | **M** |
| ~~**Jobs** (group invoices/bills under a job)~~ — **Done.** `jobs` table, domain, CRUD endpoints + web UI (customer/vendor owner) | **S–M** |

## B. Deferred bank-import formats — DONE

OFX, QIF and CSV all import into an existing account (`POST /accounts/{id}/import-bank`,
offset to Imbalance-CUR, deduped by import ref).

| Gap | Effort |
|---|---|
| ~~**OFX** import~~ — **Done.** Tolerant SGML/XML parser; FITID-based dedup | M |
| ~~**QIF** import~~ — **Done.** Content-hash dedup (no per-line id in QIF) | M |
| ~~**CSV** import~~ — **Done.** Column-mapping wizard (server preview + mapping UI), `$€£¥`/parens/sign parsing | L |

## C. Online price quotes — DONE

~~`PriceService` stores only **manually-entered** quotes — no fetch.~~ **Done.**
A pluggable `app.QuoteProvider` + a Frankfurter (ECB FX) provider back
`POST /api/v1/prices/fetch`, recording fetched rates as exact-rational prices
via the normal price write path; a "Fetch online" button in the Commodities view
drives it. Optional scheduled auto-refresh is still deferred. **Effort: M**

## D. Web UI gaps (backend ahead of frontend) — DONE

- ~~**Prices/commodities management view**~~ — **Done.** A "Commodities" nav
  view (`CommoditiesView.tsx`) lists commodities, creates them (currency or
  security), and shows/adds per-commodity price history.
- ~~**Import UI**~~ — **Done.** An "Import GnuCash" sidebar button
  (`ImportDialog.tsx`) uploads a SQLite/XML file to `POST /imports/gnucash`
  via the new `api.importGnuCash` and reports the imported object counts.

## Recommended sequencing

1. ~~**Bill terms** (A)~~ — **Done.** Unblocked correct invoice due dates.
2. ~~**Tax tables** (A)~~ — **Done.** Completed invoicing correctness.
3. ~~**Prices/commodities UI + import UI** (D)~~ — **Done.**
4. ~~**Online price quotes** (C)~~ — **Done.** Frankfurter FX provider behind `POST /prices/fetch`.
5. ~~**OFX/QIF/CSV import** (B)~~ — **Done.** All three post into an account, offset to Imbalance; CSV via a column-mapping wizard.
6. ~~**Employees & jobs** (A)~~ — **Done.** Entity CRUD (table + domain + endpoints + web) for both; expense vouchers and job-attachment-to-invoice still deferred.

**Backlog complete** — every item in sections A–D is shipped or explicitly deferred (employee expense vouchers, scheduled price auto-refresh, job→invoice linking). Re-audit before picking up new roadmap work.

## E. Next roadmap — new requests (not yet started)

Fresh feature requests beyond the original gap audit. None are built yet.

| Gap | Notes | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**Multi-language support (EN / FR / DE)**~~ — **Done.** `react-i18next` + browser-locale detection + `localStorage:ol-language` cache; EN/FR/DE catalogs; language switcher in Settings → System. | M |
| ~~**Settings section — admin & system setup screens**~~ — **Done.** Members tab (RBAC, full add/change-role/remove with last-owner guard) + System tab (language picker + default-currency picker stored in `book_preferences` via `GET/PATCH /api/v1/books/{id}/preferences`). | M–L |
| ~~**Realistic SKR04 demo ledger (with account numbers)**~~ — **Done.** `make seed-skr04` creates a German consulting-firm book with 12 SKR04-coded accounts and 16 balanced EUR transactions. | M |
| ~~**Fiscal year start**~~ — **Done.** `fiscal_year_start SMALLINT` (1–12) added to `book_preferences` (migration 0016); exposed via `GET/PATCH /api/v1/books/{id}/preferences`; Settings → System shows a month picker with a derived fiscal year end hint. End month is always computed (`start − 1`), never stored. | S |
| ~~**Vocabulary unification — "Ledger"**~~ — **Done.** All user-visible UI strings standardised on "Ledger" (was split between "Company" / "Ledger"); `Book` stays in Go types, DB table name, and API paths for GnuCash schema fidelity. `NewCompanyDialog` → `NewLedgerDialog`, setup/nav copy updated, FR/DE translations updated. | S |
| ~~**Transaction date field in TransactionDialog**~~ — **Done.** Date input added to the new/edit transaction dialog, defaulting to today; `postDate` is now passed in every `postTransaction` / `updateTransaction` API call; edit path extracts `tx.postDate` so existing transactions open with the correct date. | S |
| ~~**i18n completeness — business area**~~ — **Done.** `useTranslation` wired into `BusinessView` (tab labels, eyebrow, new-entity button, ContactForm/ContactList field labels, table headers, error messages), `BillTermsView` (full dialog + list), and `TaxTablesView` (full dialog + list). Added `business.*`, `business.terms.*`, `business.tax.*`, `dashboard.dueBanner*`, and `settings.system.fiscalYear*` keys to all three locale files (EN/FR/DE). Remaining un-wired: InvoiceView, JobsView, EmployeesView, ScheduledTransactionsView, BudgetView, CommoditiesView, PortfolioView, ImportDialog (deferred). | M |

**All items complete** as of 2026-06-21. Next work requires a fresh feature decision.
